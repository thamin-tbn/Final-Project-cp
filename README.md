# Final-Project
### Project Description

This project has been designed and developed for the purpose of teaching and applying electrical engineering concepts. Our purpose is to implement a number of widely used functions in the field of electrical engineering.

**Note:** Data should be stored in files, and user inputs and outputs should be saved and displayed upon request. Users should have the ability to modify or delete saved inputs and outputs. Proper and appropriate commenting is required. Necessary functions should be defined, and appropriate comments should be provided for each code.

### Question 1 – Hogwarts Phone Line

At Hogwarts University, to facilitate communication between students and their respective group professors, they intend to set up a telephone system. Unfortunately, only one phone line is allocated for the Snape and Gryffindor offices. University officials have asked for your assistance to write a program that receives data sent to this line as input and delivers relevant data for the Snape and Gryffindor offices separately as output.

The only difference between the data sent to these two offices is the frequency of the transmission. The signal you receive is the sum of these two signals. To separate two signals, you can use any of low-pass, band-pass or high-pass filter.

#### Problem Statement

In your program, receive the signal.
Implement the convolution function.
Find the appropriate filter.
Perform convolution of the signal with the appropriate filter and separate the signals for the two offices separately in the output.

For example consider our two signals is cos(0.2π*t) and cos(0.02π*t).

In this case, the signal we receive from the telephone line will be the following signal.

### Question 2 – Quidditch Competition

#### Part 1: Harry Potter and his friends want to participate in this year's Quidditch competition. However, the unique aspect of this year's competition is that to make it more challenging, the university officials have decided to place points with electric charge at various locations on the playing field.

Harry Potter and his friends want to become the champions this year, so they asked you to write a program to Find the electric field created by the charged points.

Your program is supposed to receive a two-dimensional array representing the playing field, where points with electrical charges are indicated by there values shown in Coulomb units. One element of the array is represented by the letter 'O', and your program should calculate the electric field at point O and display it in the output. To do this, create a function that takes an array as input and returns a list with two elements, representing the magnitude of the field in the x and y directions, respectively.

For example, your input might be:

#### Part 2: Hagrid has a great fondness for straight lines, he after hearing about your program, asks you to calculate the electric field at a distance of one meter from the center of a 50-meter straight line with a uniform charge density of 1C.

### Question 3 – Smart Attendance System

Dumbledore wants to design an intelligent attendance system using artificial intelligence, but he realizes that he needs an edge detection system for this purpose. He has heard that by applying two-dimensional convolution on an image with an appropriate filter, this task can be accomplished. Since you have implemented a function for the convolution operation effectively, he asks you to do this task for him.

Our requirements from you:
1. Read the image file and convert it into a two-dimensional array.
2. Create a function that takes a two-dimensional array as an image and another two-dimensional array as a filter, performs two-dimensional convolution on these two, and returns the result of this operation.
3. Find the appropriate filter for edge detection.
4. Perform the convolution operation on the image and filter, then display the result in the output.

### Optional Task 1 - Hogwarts Electrical Wiring

This extra section is worth 2 additional points for the project.

Dumbledore wants to wire Hogwarts for electricity. For this purpose, he uses a three-phase transformer to deliver power to consumers. The transformer type is EI and its inputs are primary and secondary voltages and currents. Your task is to calculate the core cross-sectional area based on the specified power and current density, and calculate the number of turns of primary and secondary based on input and output voltages. Dumbledore gives you the initial problem statement, and you should find the correct solution with appropriate coding. Depending on the situation and encountered problems, Dumbledore may ask you to simultaneously solve both tasks or only one of them. Sometimes, due to his age and absent-mindedness, Dumbledore may make a mistake, and your code should be able to respond to Dumbledore at any time.

### Optional Task 2 - Dumbledore and His Strange Requests

This extra section is worth 2 additional points for the project.

Dumbledore, in order to encourage people to go to Hogwarts, asks you to make your code user-friendly using a GUI and gain people's trust through Unit Tests.

Implementation of a Graphical User Interface (GUI): Implement a graphical user interface using Tkinter or PyQt (it must show input signals and signals sent to each office).

Unit Test: Create comprehensive tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of project calculations and functionalities.
